            A <b><em>Tag</em></b> is an HTML label describing the content of an HTML page. Tags are always contained within a less than and a more than brackets. And in most cases are used in pairs, an opening tag "(tag)" and a closing tag "(/tag)".

          <p>
            A <b><em>Void Tag</em></b> has no content and therefore does not require a closing tag. Examples of a void tag are the bracket tag "(br), and image tag "(img)".

            This means that a computer cannot reason, "figure out" what a programmer might have meant for it to do, but rather that unless precise instructions are given, a computer will not know what to do. It has to be guided step by step, and thus, the programmer has to code in this manner.

            A user sends a request to obtain an HTML Page that contains the information requires through a browser. The requests travels through the Internet which is comprised of the biggest network of computers through a series of preset rules of how that information is to be sent, travel, received and reassembled by the server that contains the information requested. The server returns the information using the same set  of rules, called the HTTP protocol, or Hyper Text Transport Protocol, providing the URL to the user's browser or Uniform Resource Locator of where that HTML resides and the browser interprets the HTML code in a viewable manner for the user to see, read or hear.

            It was discussed the path from being a novice to an expert. All a novice starts with are scattered facts, and a gap exists between that and becoming an expert. Reflection is what allows the novice to gap the distance from novice to expert. While one might have good ideas, in order to achieve the ability to execute them, one has to gap this distance through practice until one can act as an expert implementer of such ideas.

            Browsers provide developer tools that allow the programmer to see the HTML coding and to code in a <em>"tree"</em> form. That means to code in a way that represents a tree: A trunk, branches, twigs, leafs, fruit. In other words, to code in a way that similar elements, or similar content can be placed within sections and add notes that will help identify and change the code in a future. (div) tags are used to separate content into boxes. (span) tags are used for inline elements.

        <div class="concept-lesson-title">

            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets
		      </p>
	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-lesson-description">
	        <p>
            CSS provides a way to avoid repetition, and an easier way to change the attributes of like elements at once providing consistency. The cleaner the code is (less repetition) the easier it will be to follow and the faster it will load.
          </p>
	        <p>
            Coding should always be <b><em>"structured"</em></b>, meaning that divisions (div) tags have been used to separate logically combined elements into blocks for easier manipulation, understanding, and debugging, thus the term <b><em>"Cascading"</em></b>.
	        </p>
          <p>
            The term <b><em>"Styles"</em></b> term comes from the fact that the elements in the HTML coding can be manipulated with different <b><em>"selectors"</em></b> such as font, size, color, etc. These styles can be specified to particular elements, but CSS Styles are better applied when similar elements are manipulated at once by these selectors, such as headers, content, titles, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term <b><em>"Sheets"</em></b> refers to the fact that many different set of CSS coding can be defined for one HTML document, each one having unique coding to different parts of the HTML page. However, one must be careful not to create many CSS sheets when the code could be included in only one. It is important to point out that changing the visual properties of an element only change the way that they are displayed by the browser, and not the type of element that it is.

            Inheritance
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-lesson-description">
          <p>
            <b>CSS</b> has a key feature called <b><em>"Inheritance"</em></b>, which means that the properties are not just applied to a specific element, but also to its descendant elements on a tree structure, in other words, according to its hierarchy, also called nesting. However, two things must be remembered:
          </p>
	        <p>
            1.	The most descriptive style is the one that overrules the style.
            <br>
            2.	Box related properties are not inherited
          </p>
	         <p>
            The properties that <b>can be inherited</b> are: color, font, letter spacing, line height, list style, text align, text indent, text transform, visibility, white space and word spacing.   
          </p>
	        <p>
            The properties that <b>cannot be inherited</b> are: background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min and max height and width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text decoration, vertical align and z-index.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inheritance reduces the amount of code that developers need to write.

	      <div class="concept-lesson-description">
	        <p>
            A <b><em>"Selector"</em></b> specifies the element or like elements that it will modify. The coding of the selector contains the <em>element</em>, a <em>left curly bracket</em> on the first line. On the second line an <em>attribute followed by a colon</em>, a <em>value followed by a semi colon</em> on the second line. And a <em>right curly bracket</em> on line three, closing the selector.
	        </p>
		      <p>
            An example would be:
            <br>
            .content {
            <br>
              color: green;

	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-lesson-description">
        	<p>
	          Everything that is contained within the curly brackets is called a <b><em>rule</em></b>. The rule is applied to the element.

            <b>There are 3 methods to add CSS into a Web Page:</b>
	          <br>
            <br><b>1) Adding the CSS code into the <em>Head</em> section of the HTML page.</b> Good for small projects.
          </p>
	        <p>
            <b>2) Writing the CSS code into a separate file and linking it to the Web page</b>. The link should be placed within the <em>Head</em> section of the HTML page with come such as: left bracket followed by: link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css", closing with a right bracket. This is particularly more efficient for larger projects.
	        </p>
		      <p>
	          <b>3) Writing the CSS code inline with the HTML code.</b> This is the least effective method as it creates repetition and thus inefficient coding, larger lines of code, and slower processing, as well as the opportunity for more mistakes.

	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-lesson-description">
	        <p>
            <b><em>Code Comments</em></b> are comments left by the programmer to remind himself of particulars that would not to forgot and that will help him identify and troubleshoot particular areas of the code, as well as for all other programmers that will look into the code. Properly coded these comments are not displayed by the browser, so they can only be seen through the coding.
	        </p>
		      <p>
	          Example:
	          <br>
          	<br>
	          <b>Comments in HTML</b>
          </p>
	        <p>
            In <b>HTML</b> code comments begin with a left bracket, an exlamation sign, and two dashes, it is then followed by the comment or comments, and it closes with two dashes and a right bracket.
	        </p>
		      <p>
            In <b>CSS</b> code comments begin with "/*", followed by the comment or comments, and it closes with */".

	          Boxes
	      	</p>
	      </div>
	      <div class="concept-lesson-description">
        	<p>
            In HTML all elements are boxes, even as they are not necessarily displayed by the browsers. Each box, going from the core out is formed by the <b><em>content</em></b> at its core, then surrounded by the <b><em>padding</em></b> which is a clear space around the content that avoids overlapping and that is affected by the background color of the box. The padding is surrounded by a <b><em>border</em></b> which inherits from the box too, and the border is surrounded by a <b><em>margin</em></b> which is the transparent outer space of the box.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            To calculate the size of a box one must add the width of the content, plus both sizes of the padding, plus the size of both sides of the border. Sizing these boxes in a precise manner is complicated. There are 3 ways to do this:
	        </p>
		      <p>
	          <b>1) You can specify the size of the box in pixels</b> which is a hard form of sizing them and they never change in size.
